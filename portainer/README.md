# Portainer Service

The Portainer service provides a lightweight management UI for Docker environments, enabling users to manage containers, images, networks, and volumes with ease. This service is configured to run locally with SSL/TLS certificates for secure access.

## Directory Structure

```
portainer/
├── docker-compose.yml       # Docker Compose configuration for the Portainer service
├── certs/                   # Directory containing SSL/TLS certificates
│   ├── portainer.crt        # SSL certificate
│   ├── portainer.key        # SSL private key
│   └── README.md            # Instructions for generating certificates
└── data/                    # Directory for Portainer's persistent data
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- `mkcert` installed for generating SSL/TLS certificates.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Generate Certificates**
   Follow the instructions in `certs/README.md` to generate the required SSL/TLS certificates.

2. **Start the Service**
   Use Docker Compose to start the Portainer service:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start the Portainer service in detached mode.

3. **Access the UI**
   Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost` to access the Portainer UI. Use the credentials you set during the initial setup.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the SSL/TLS certificates are correctly generated and placed in the `certs/` directory.
- Check the logs for any errors:

  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

- Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are properly installed and running.
